3. **Ask Informed Questions**: Your AI assistant will understand the bounty requirements and can help you plan your approach

#### AI-Assisted Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone git@github.com:AkongaLabs/saas-panda.git your-bounty-solution
cd your-bounty-solution

# 2. Use AI to understand requirements
# Ask your AI: "Help me analyze the bounty requirements and plan my approach"

# 3. AI-assisted coding
# Example prompts:
# - "Generate TypeScript interfaces for this bounty's data model"
# - "Create comprehensive tests for the critical user flow described in the bounty"
# - "Help me implement this feature following the tech stack requirements"
```

#### Best AI Prompts for Bounty Development
- **Planning**: "Analyze the bounty requirements and create a development plan"
- **Architecture**: "Design the database schema and API structure for this bounty"
- **Testing**: "Generate comprehensive tests for [specific feature] covering all critical flows"
- **Documentation**: "Help me write self-documenting code and clear setup instructions"
- **Review**: "Review my code against the bounty requirements and quality standards"

### AI Advantages for Bounties

Using AI tools with our `.cursorrules` configuration gives you:
- **Faster Development**: AI understands our patterns and can generate boilerplate quickly
- **Quality Assurance**: AI knows our standards and can help ensure compliance
- **Testing Support**: AI can generate comprehensive test suites for critical flows
- **Documentation**: AI can help create self-documenting code and clear documentation
- **Technical Guidance**: AI understands our tech stack and can provide specific guidance

### AI Development Tips

#### Do's ‚úÖ
- **Use AI for boilerplate generation** following our tech stack requirements
- **Ask AI to review your code** against bounty requirements before submission
- **Leverage AI for test generation** to ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Use AI to explain complex code** to ensure it's self-documenting
- **Ask AI for optimization suggestions** within our simplicity guidelines

#### Don'ts ‚ùå
- **Don't rely solely on AI** - understand and review all generated code
- **Don't ignore the bounty requirements** - AI should supplement, not replace careful reading
- **Don't submit code you don't understand** - you must be able to explain your implementation
- **Don't skip testing** - AI-generated code still needs thorough testing

### Getting Help with AI Tools

If you're new to AI-assisted development:
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts and gradually get more specific
2. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on AI responses
3. **Verify**: Always test and verify AI-generated code
4. **Learn**: Use AI as a learning tool to understand our tech stack better

**Remember**: AI is a powerful accelerator, but the final submission must meet all bounty requirements and be code you fully understand and can maintain.
