# Akong'a Labs OSS Bounties

We're building stuff. Want to help? Get paid.

## What's This About?

[Akong'a Labs](https://akongalabs.com) posts development tasks as GitHub issues. You build the solution, submit a PR, and if it works, you get paid. Simple.

First valid submission wins. No beauty contests, no politics.

## How It Works

1. **Browse Issues** - Check what bounties are available
2. **Build & Submit** - Create your solution, submit a PR  
3. **Get Paid** - First working solution gets the money

## ⚠️ Payment Reality Check

We ONLY pay via Binance (USDT/USDC). No PayPal, no bank transfers, no Bitcoin, no exceptions. 

Don't have Binance? Don't start working. 

Can't use Binance in your country? Sorry, these bounties aren't for you.

## Legal Stuff (The Important Bit)

Submit a PR = your code becomes open source. We can use it whether you win or not. That's the deal.

## What We Actually Need

**Tech Stack** (non-negotiable):
- React + Vite
- React Router V7  
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- TypeScript (no `any` types)
- Works with Bun (Yarn needs justification)

**Quality Bars**:
- Your code works
- Your code has tests for critical flows
- Your code explains itself (if we have to ask questions, you're out)
- You provide a working demo

**Starter Template**: [`saas-panda`](https://github.com/AkongaLabs/saas-panda) - use it or don't, up to you.

## Getting Started

1. Find a bounty in [Issues](../../issues)
2. Read it carefully (seriously, read the whole thing)
3. Ask questions in the issue comments BEFORE coding
4. Build your solution
5. Test everything  
6. Submit PR with the template from [docs/SUBMISSION.md](docs/SUBMISSION.md)
7. Tag `@adrianmurage` for review

**Quick Commands**:
```bash
# Clone starter (optional)
git clone git@github.com:AkongaLabs/saas-panda.git your-solution
cd your-solution
bun install
bun run dev
```

## AI Tools

We included a `.cursorrules` file for AI editors like Cursor. Use AI, don't use AI - whatever gets the job done.

## The Fine Print
