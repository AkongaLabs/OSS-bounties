# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and straight answers.

## AI Development Tools

**Q: Should I use AI tools to build my solution?**
A: Use whatever helps you build working code faster. We included a `.cursorrules` file for AI editors like Cursor.

**Q: What AI editors work with the .cursorrules file?**
A: Cursor, Zed, and other AI-powered editors that support configuration files.

**Q: What's in the .cursorrules file?**
A: Project context, tech requirements, coding standards, and submission guidelines. Helps AI assistants understand what we want.

**Q: Can I submit AI-generated code?**
A: Sure, but you must understand every line. If we ask questions and you can't explain your code, you're disqualified.

**Q: Any tips for using AI effectively?**
A: 
- Ask AI to review your code against bounty requirements
- Use AI for boilerplate generation following our tech stack
- Generate comprehensive tests for critical flows
- Don't blindly copy-paste AI output

## Communication & Process

**Q: How do I ask questions about a bounty?**
A: In the GitHub issue comments, publicly, before you start coding.

**Q: Can I message you privately about bounties?**
A: No. All communication must be public in GitHub issues.

**Q: When will you respond to questions?**
A: Within 24-48 hours during business days.

**Q: Can I ask for hints or partial solutions?**
A: No. Figure it out yourself or don't participate.

**Q: What if I disagree with a judging decision?**
A: Decisions are final. No appeals, no arguments.

## Technical Questions

**Q: Can I use Next.js instead of Vite?**
A: No. React + Vite is required.

**Q: What about Prisma instead of Drizzle?**
A: No. Drizzle ORM is required.

**Q: Why can't I use npm?**
A: Because we said Bun or Yarn only. npm causes dependency issues in our workflow.

**Q: Do I have to use the starter template?**
A: No, but it'll save you setup time. Your choice.

**Q: How much test coverage do you need?**
A: We don't care about percentages. Test the critical user flows that matter.

**Q: What counts as "self-documenting code"?**
A: Code that's clear without external explanation. Good variable names, clear structure, logical flow.

**Q: Can I use external APIs or services?**
A: Depends on the bounty requirements. Ask in the issue comments.

## Submission Process

**Q: What if I submit late?**
A: You're disqualified. Deadlines are deadlines.

**Q: Can I fix my PR after submission?**
A: No. Any changes after submission = automatic disqualification.

**Q: What if I find a bug after submitting?**
A: Too bad. Test thoroughly before submitting.

**Q: Can I submit multiple PRs for the same bounty?**
A: No. One submission per person per bounty.

**Q: What makes a "working demo"?**
A: Either a deployed application we can access, or a comprehensive video showing all functionality.

## Payment Issues

**Q: Why only Binance?**
A: Because that's our payment method. Don't like it? Don't participate.

**Q: What if I win but can't receive crypto payments?**
A: You forfeit your winnings. Should have checked this before participating.

**Q: Can you make an exception for my payment method?**
A: No exceptions. Ever.

**Q: What if I live somewhere crypto is illegal?**
A: That's your problem to solve before participating.

**Q: How do I prove my Binance account is verified?**
A: Screenshot of your account status page (with sensitive info blurred).

## Development Environment

**Q: What Node.js version should I use?**
A: Latest LTS version. Currently Node 20+.

**Q: Any specific PostgreSQL version?**
A: PostgreSQL 14+ is fine.

**Q: Do I need Docker?**
A: Not required unless specified in the bounty.

**Q: What about deployment?**
A: For demos, use Vercel, Netlify, Railway, or similar. Keep it simple.

## Common Mistakes

**Q: Why was my submission rejected?**
A: Probably because you:
- Didn't follow the tech stack requirements
- Missing or failing tests
- Code doesn't actually work
- No working demo
- Incomplete PR template
- Used wrong package manager without justification

**Q: Can you give feedback on my approach before I submit?**
A: No. Build it, test it, submit it, then we'll review it.

**Q: What if the bounty requirements are unclear?**
A: Ask specific questions in the issue comments before starting.

## Competition & Fairness

**Q: How do you prevent people from copying solutions?**
A: We don't. First working submission wins. If someone copies and submits first, they win.

**Q: What if multiple people submit at the same time?**
A: GitHub timestamps determine the winner.

**Q: Can I collaborate with others?**
A: Bounties are individual challenges unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Q: What if someone submits a better solution after the winner is chosen?**
A: Too late. First valid submission wins, period.

## Getting Help

**Q: I'm stuck on the technical implementation. Can you help?**
A: Ask specific technical questions in the issue comments. We might point you in the right direction.

**Q: Can you recommend learning resources?**
A: Google exists. Stack Overflow exists. Documentation exists. Use them.

**Q: What if I'm new to some of the required technologies?**
A: Learn them or don't participate. Bounties aren't tutorials.
