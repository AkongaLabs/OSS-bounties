# Payment Process

We pay winners. Here's how it works.

## Payment Method (No Exceptions)

**Binance only. USDT or USDC only. No alternatives.**

Don't have Binance? Don't participate.

Can't use Binance in your country? These bounties aren't for you.

Want Bitcoin, Ethereum, PayPal, bank transfer, or anything else? Not happening.

## Before You Start Any Bounty

Make sure you have:
- [ ] Active, verified Binance account
- [ ] Ability to receive USDT or USDC
- [ ] Understanding that you'll forfeit winnings if you can't accept payment this way

**If you can't tick all these boxes, don't waste your time building anything.**

## Winner Payment Process

### Step 1: You Win (Within 24 hours)
- We announce the winner in the GitHub issue and PR
- Winner gets tagged with payment instructions
- You have 48 hours to respond

### Step 2: Payment Info Collection (2-3 business days)
You need to provide:
- **Binance account email**
- **Binance UID (User ID)**
- **Preferred currency**: USDT or USDC
- **Preferred network**: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.
- **Confirmation your account is verified**

### Step 3: Payment Sent (3-5 business days)
- Payment processed within 5 business days
- Transaction hash provided as proof
- You monitor your Binance account

**Total timeline: 5-8 business days from win to payment**

## Forfeiture Policy (The Important Part)

### You Forfeit Your Winnings If:
- No verified Binance account
- Can't or won't provide payment info
- Don't respond to payment notifications
- Refuse USDT/USDC payment method

### 6-Month Holding Period
- If you forfeit but might claim later, we hold your winnings for exactly 6 months
- No extensions, no exceptions
- During this time, you can claim by providing valid Binance info

### After 6 Months
- Unclaimed winnings are permanently forfeited
- Money gets donated to an open source project chosen by @adrianmurage
- All donations are publicly documented in this repo

## Tax Implications

**We don't provide tax advice.** 

You're responsible for:
- Understanding your local tax laws
- Reporting crypto income if required
- Paying any taxes owed
- Dealing with any legal issues in your jurisdiction

## Payment Confirmation

When payment is sent:
- Transaction hash provided
- You can verify on blockchain explorer
- No refunds or reversals once sent
- Payment disputes won't be entertained

## Common Payment Issues

**"I never received payment"**
- Check your Binance account
- Verify the transaction hash on blockchain explorer
- Make sure you provided correct details

**"Payment went to wrong address"**
- If you provided wrong info, that's on you
- Double-check everything before submitting

**"I want to change payment method after winning"**
- Too late. Binance USDT/USDC or forfeit.

## Bottom Line

We made the payment method crystal clear upfront. If you participate knowing you can't receive payment this way, you're choosing to forfeit your winnings.

No sympathy for people who ignore this and then complain.

**tl;dr**: Win bounty → Provide Binance details → Get paid in USDT/USDC → Done. Can't do this process? Don't participate.
